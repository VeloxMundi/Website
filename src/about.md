_**Velox Mundi Factori**_ is Latin for "A Quick World Maker," and that's exactly what the Velox Mundi app is.

With _Velox Mundi,_ you can build an entire world by simply creating pages. Each page that you create will be saved as an HTML file that can be displayed in your browser. Create your worlds locally and, when you are ready, publish them to your own website.

Although you can build your world as easily as you can write the content for your pages, _Velox Mundi_ can do so much more. Pages can automatically be linked to one another anywhere in the text with the touch of a button. And you can design your website any way you want using our own designer or your own custom stylesheets (css).
